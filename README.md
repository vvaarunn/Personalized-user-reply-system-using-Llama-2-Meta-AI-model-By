Personalized User Reply System using Llama 2 Meta-AI Model
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance customer engagement and improve the online reputation of small-scale businesses by automatically generating personalized responses to social media comments using the Llama 2 Meta-AI model. The system scrapes user comments from review platforms like Yelp and Google Reviews, interprets the context of the comments, and generates human-like, contextually relevant replies.

By using pre-trained transformer models, this system helps businesses save time, maintain consistent communication, and engage meaningfully with their customers.

Key Features
Scrapes user comments from Google Reviews and Yelp.
Fine-tunes the Llama 2 Meta-AI model to generate personalized replies.
Performs sentiment analysis to determine the tone (positive/negative) of comments.
Deploys the system as a simple web interface for easy use.
Pipeline integration for efficient execution from data collection to response generation.
