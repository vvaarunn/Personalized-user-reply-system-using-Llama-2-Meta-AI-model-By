Personalized User Reply System using Llama 2 Meta-AI Model
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance customer engagement and improve the online reputation of small-scale businesses by automatically generating personalized replies to social media comments using the Llama 2 Meta-AI model.

The system scrapes user comments from platforms like Yelp and Google Reviews and generates personalized, contextually relevant responses. This can help businesses save time and maintain engagement with customers in a more efficient way.

Key Features:
Scrapes social media comments (Yelp, Google Reviews).
Fine-tunes the Llama 2 Meta-AI model to generate personalized replies.
Sentiment analysis for determining positive or negative tone in replies.
Web scraping functionality for collecting comments from business reviews.
Steps to Implement:
1. Setting Up the Environment
Install necessary Python packages for the project:
bash
Copy code
pip install transformers langchain beautifulsoup4 requests
Set up the Hugging Face transformers library to access pre-trained models.
2. Data Collection and Web Scraping
Scrape reviews and comments from Yelp and Google Reviews.
For Yelp, use BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape comments.
Ensure compliance with Yelp and Google's scraping policies and respect their terms of service.
Example code for scraping Yelp comments:
python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_yelp_reviews(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    reviews = soup.find_all('p', class_='comment')
    return [review.text for review in reviews]

reviews = scrape_yelp_reviews("URL_HERE")
3. Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the scraped comments.
Tasks include:
Removing special characters, URLs, and unnecessary words.
Tokenizing text for easier model understanding.
Optionally, perform sentiment analysis on comments to understand the tone.
4. Fine-Tuning Llama 2 Model
Load a pre-trained Llama 2 model from Hugging Face:
python
Copy code
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("llama-2")
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("llama-2")
Fine-tune the model on the dataset of social media comments, adjusting parameters as needed.
5. Sentiment Analysis
Implement sentiment analysis to detect the tone (positive, negative) of the comments.
Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model or create your own:
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
sentiment = sentiment_analyzer("The food was amazing!")
print(sentiment)
6. Generating Responses
Use the fine-tuned model to generate responses to comments.
Sample code for generating a reply:
python
Copy code
inputs = tokenizer("This is a great place!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=100)
reply = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(reply)
7. Web Interface (Optional)
Develop a simple web interface where users can input comments and receive replies.
Use Flask or Streamlit for quick deployment:
bash
Copy code
pip install flask
Flask setup for web interface:
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_comment = request.form['comment']
        response = generate_response(user_comment)
        return render_template("index.html", response=response)
    return render_template("index.html")

def generate_response(comment):
    # Call your Llama 2 model here
    return "This is a response!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
8. Model Deployment (Optional)
Host the model on a cloud platform such as Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.
Optimize the model using techniques like quantization for faster inference times.
9. Testing the System
Once the system is ready, test the model on a variety of comments to ensure it generates appropriate and contextually relevant replies.
Adjust the training dataset or model parameters as needed to improve performance.
10. Final Documentation and GitHub Repository
Document the entire process thoroughly in this README.
Upload the project files to GitHub, including:
Python code files (e.g., scraper.py, model.py).
Data files (e.g., Black_Bear_Diner_raw.csv).
Model files if necessary.
11. Next Steps
In future iterations, you can improve the system by including more advanced features like multi-platform scraping or integrating with other AI models for better context understanding.
You could also explore additional ways of personalizing replies further, such as incorporating user history or more detailed sentiment analysis.
