Personalized User Reply System using Llama 2 Meta-AI Model
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance customer engagement and improve the online reputation of small-scale businesses by automatically generating personalized responses to social media comments using the Llama 2 Meta-AI model. The system scrapes user comments from review platforms like Yelp and Google Reviews, interprets the context of the comments, and generates human-like, contextually relevant replies.

By using pre-trained transformer models, this system helps businesses save time, maintain consistent communication, and engage meaningfully with their customers.

Key Features
Scrapes user comments from Google Reviews and Yelp.
Fine-tunes the Llama 2 Meta-AI model to generate personalized replies.
Performs sentiment analysis to determine the tone (positive/negative) of comments.
Deploys the system as a simple web interface for easy use.
Pipeline integration for efficient execution from data collection to response generation.

Steps to Implement
1. Setting Up the Environment
Create a new Python virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install the necessary dependencies from requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Data Collection (Scraping Yelp/Google Reviews)
Yelp Scraping:
The scraper.py script uses BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape comments from Yelp listings. Here's an example:
python
Copy code
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_yelp_reviews(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    reviews = soup.find_all('p', class_='comment')
    return [review.text for review in reviews]
Ensure that you have proper authorization to scrape reviews from these platforms and adhere to their terms of service.
3. Sentiment Analysis
We use transformers library to detect the sentiment (positive or negative) of each review using a pre-trained sentiment model:
python
Copy code
from transformers import pipeline

sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')

def get_sentiment(text):
    result = sentiment_analyzer(text)
    return result[0]['label']  # 'POSITIVE' or 'NEGATIVE'
4. Fine-Tuning the Llama 2 Model
We load the Llama 2 model using the transformers library and fine-tune it on your dataset. Here's how to load the pre-trained model:
python
Copy code
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("llama-2")
tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("llama-2")
You can fine-tune the model on your dataset (scraped reviews) using the appropriate training loops or transfer learning strategies.
5. Generating Replies
After fine-tuning the model, you can use it to generate responses to user comments:
python
Copy code
inputs = tokenizer("This place is amazing!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(inputs['input_ids'], max_length=100)
reply = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(reply)
6. Building the Web Interface
To allow users to interact with the system, we've built a simple Flask web application.
Here's a basic example of setting up the web app (app.py):
python
Copy code
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from model import generate_reply  # A function that generates replies using the Llama model

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_comment = request.form['comment']
        response = generate_reply(user_comment)
        return render_template("index.html", response=response)
    return render_template("index.html")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
7. Model Deployment
After fine-tuning the model, deploy it on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku) to make it available for real-time use.
You may also optimize the model using techniques like quantization or pruning for faster response times.
8. Testing
Test the system by entering different comments on the web interface to see if it generates relevant, contextually accurate responses.
You can refine the model or improve sentiment analysis to make the replies more accurate.
