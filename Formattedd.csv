"Love this place, especially when you get Ashley as your waitress she is so friendly and polite and has this great smile and friendly attitude"
"Food has really gone down here since it opened. I used to get excited about coming, but multiple orders of lukewarm biscuits and gravy and very subpar burgers has me understanding why a Dennys could come in next door with no issues. ‚Ä¶"
"Came here for breakfast after an appointment and was seated right away. Our server was nice and good came out fairly quickly. The potatoes were too salty for me, but everything else was good. Good amount of food."
"Bn eating at this place when it was UncleJohns long time ago. It was comfort food then as now, but very good food. If you want fancy food go somewhere else. If you want old school, here it is. I only gave 4 hoku‚≠ê ‚Ä¶"
"They have a good menu but what always happens to me is that they serve cold food and it is not the fault of the employees, what happens is that the place fills up and they have very few staff. There was only one waiter serving that day and a man who collected the plates."
"March 2024. My father and I went out to breakfast for my birthday. It was on a Sunday and neither of us thought about how busy the restaurant might be. It was right after the church rush, I know because I was leaving church myself. My dad ‚Ä¶"
"It was late night, super hungry, the servers were handling more than their numbers allowed but they did a great job nonetheless."
Extremely fast service for 2 people (even with a packed house)! The food was great and came relatively quickly. Our server was extremely efficient and friendly! ‚Ä¶
Worst service ever.. never received even a glass of water. I Never even talked to a waiter. They literally walked passed me for over 30 minutes.  Several people that came in after me was served an waited on . Spoke to the manager about there service an didn't even get apology. I guess my money wasn't welcome there..
"To be honest, the only reason that this place got a 4 is due to the fact that they didn't serve out the can corned beef hash. But with that being said the corned beef looked a couple of days old. I'm fully aware fresh corned beef would be a ‚Ä¶"
"Nice friendly Atmosphere & service üëå Updated on February 26, 2024. Delicious food & good customer service. ‚Ä¶"
"Not too many 24 hour resturants left post Covid. Nice to have a much better option than Denny's. Food is better, service is better, and portion/price it's a much better value."
Vanessa was wonderful server. Everything she offered was fantastic! Thank you Vanessa for the great service üôÇ ‚Ä¶
Great food at a fair price
We met at restaurant for a family party. Great selection and service.
"Poor service, tables and window seals are dirty with dead insects. Food was was like something served at a senior center for dietary restrictions. I had blacked Salmon with pesto pasta. Others in my party enjoyed food. A few soft drinks were flat and real syrupy."
"Was served cold chili. It came back microwaved. Real poor service. Cannot recommend.

Our waitress was really lovely. I don't remember her name but she had black nails and spoke Spanish hella fast for 5am lol

Simply delicious
"My favorite restaurant, no matter what city I find it in!"
"The Food was amazing! I would want ot go to this restaurant again! Also Lucy, she's very good and fast! Very good service and restaurant! Please I recommend this!"
Lucy is good server.
"We went for dinner on a Friday night, and were seated right away. The food was GREAT, and so was the service! All the little black bears in the gift shop r just adorable!!! We took lots of pictures with the carved bears outside, because they r just adorable, too!"
Went here a couple days ago with the family to get some breakfast. The next day a few of us who had eaten the gravy for the biscuits and chicken fried steak began to show signs of food poisoning. I'd be less angry if it was just me and my partner but my 9 year old brother got sick too. Unacceptable. Avoid the gravy
"The low score on service is not directed at the waitress. There is only so much one can do being short staffed or when the kitchen screws up the order.   The food was good,  but as previously called out, it was delivered wrong."
Our server Amanda was great!
"I called and was placed on hold, and when the girl came back, she hung up on me.
I decided not to go to one of my favorite restaurants."
Staff was unfriendly and inattentive
"I love Black Bear Dinner.  The service and food quality are very consistent in all of them. In this case, my two star rating is just for the Hayward location. I have dietary medical restrictions.  I asked my server for a children's menu. ‚Ä¶"
"Solid diner atmosphere. Plates always feel a little heavier proportioned on the dine in, bit they are consistent. My kids love it, their fruit side is fresh, hash browns good, and menu options plentiful."
Good food and service
A lovely brunch with friends. Food and service were faultless.
"Great food, lots of choices. This was my first time going.  Atmosphere was cute with the black bear theme. However, the ladies that were working on Sunday, had no smiles left to give! Smile, you are working!!"
My food was served fast and hot

Try the huckleberry shake!
"Service is great and ocation is clean, but food is average. Egg of omelette was so thin couldn't taste it."
The food was unbelievably delicious.  They give you large portions enough for a second meal.  The food is fresh and expertly prepared.  It's my number one place to eat.
Big portions at a fair prices
"My sister and I had breakfast, it was delicious üòã. ‚Ä¶"
"Endless mimosa at brunch. Good food, nice staff breakfast all day"
Terrible service and when I went to go pay I asked for a pumpkin pie and the rude woman behind the counter was like what‚Äôs a pumpkin pie? I was like did you not understand what I said i clearly said it nicely if as she Ignored me and then ‚Ä¶
Awesome diner.
Took over an hour to get food an the kids food came out last despite our asking for it early on. This caused for a very unhappy hangers child. ‚Ä¶
Served old smelly grits
"I like their food serving taste really good ,, the  portion is big in a reasonable price ."
Love all the bears üêª and the food was tasty. ‚Ä¶
Very rich and family-friendly breakfasts

Excellent food and service!
Food was delicious! Always consistent.  Service wasn't great... she never checked back in and we had to flag her down for our check and boxes.
The food was amazing and filled me up perfectly. I even had some leftovers to take home and have.
Very nice staff and area.
"The service is not very good, the waiter serves you and does not come back to ask if everything is okay."
Friendly and very helpful staff pairs well with the delicious comfort food
Excellent place to share with family or friends.
"Delish breakfast experience! Menu selection, price, atmosphere and best of all wait service impeccable!  Ashley is a great representation of quality of Black Bear Diner, Hayward. Definitely worth regular visits.üëçüòãüíï ‚Ä¶"
"I had a fantastic dining experience here! My server was awesome: friendly,  attentive,  and professional! The food was delicious! I ordered the tri-tip and rib combo with sweet potato fries and broccoli. Portions were generous and prepared as requested. I'll be back on my next visit."
"Every thing pleasant, satisfactory food & service."
"Crowded but the food was surprisingly good, and everybody's food around us looked good also. But they need to get a gluten-free menu going and always have crayons on hand for the little guys...."
Loved the place the staff were great
The Bear the bomb!
We went there after we buried my brother-in-law mark and the food was great it was one waitress she was a young Spanish girl and she was wonderful good customer service courtesy Pleasant patient real good service
"DO NOT ORDER GRITS they're horrible

The overall quality went down tremendously this year."
"Good food, as always. Clean tables and floor. Lucy is a great waitress."
Great place to eat anytime of day
That night was ok until the waiters start arguments with each other and totally forgot about the customers. Not good experience.
I love there burger salad.  Unfortunately this visit my son's pancakes were not cooked  in the middle and instead of preparing fresh ones they just reused what he had ...
If your not a regular be prepared to not receive service as fsst as a regular as i did was seated 10 minutes later got drinks across from me 14 minutes later came in 2 peaple who happen to be regulars got taken care of befor i could order ‚Ä¶
Nice location
We went there for my husband's big dinner after church. It was about maybe 15 of us so it was a real good time. A lot of catching up with old friends and like I said a good time. In a food just makes it better
Has great biscuits and gravy and hashbrowns
Always a good place to enjoy a  meal. Worth the wait at times!
My son and I have been eating there since you opened but this time the food was terrible I ordered Tritip which was very chewy and tough I never had meat that tough.  My son ordered chicken and waffles which he didn't finish either he said looks like maybe you changed cooks.  Was very disappointed this time don't know if we will return.
Lovely place to have breakfast with kids.
"Packed during brunch. Fast service and good food!

Looking forward to trying the bottomless mimosas soon!"
I always enjoy my food and service when I go there.
"Quick lunch out by myself. The server was always close around, but not hovering."
"I'm not big on breakfast dining out, but we tried this place and it was great.  We'll be back with a bigger appetite!
The Eggs Benedict is delicious!"
Service was horrible. Been to many of these and this location is the only one where service was literally awful. Totally insulted.
Food was extremely mid. Service was acceptable. Decent option for late night.
I drove from Castro Valley only because they said they offered outside seating. I get here it's not open. A total waste of time and gas .
"The atmosphere was family friendly and our waitress was awesome and saw to my needs.
I had the Chilli. It was like home made."
"Nice place to bring the family. Also, kids eat free from 4pm-9pm so that certainly helps! When we got our plates, I was surprised to see the pancake was shaped like a bear with eyes made of banana slices with chocolate chips, etc. (see ‚Ä¶"
"Definitely a great place to eat. I eat as different as I can. To me this diner is a pivot, am glad I took. My server was amazing, up until he clocked out. Not informing us if we wanted the bill before he left. Lastly, their seats hurt my back, soo stiff."
"They deliver our food an a dirty dish cart other than that I mean I guess it was ok, our server was nice and attentive other than the dirty dish cart that our food was carried on it was good"
"The service started well, then went downhill. However, the general manager made it right. I will definitely come again."
My dine in experience has always been great.  The waitstaff is just phenomenal.
"I have been to other Black Bear Diner sites multiple times, and have always enjoyed the food and service. ‚Ä¶"
Biscuits were great
I love this place
Friendly service but a bit too slow. Food is average/ good. Price is reasonable. Would be a nice place to spend a morning or early afternoon to have brunch with friends and family.
The food was good but the help was slow
"The clerks were kind and respectful, and they answered my inquiries in fine detail regarding their menu items. This place may compete with Denny‚Äôs and IHOP, but Black Bear Diner is in the same boat as Emil Villa‚Äôs California BBQ: better ‚Ä¶"
"You pay for what you get. Food is okay.  Service is okay although the food came out fast, it took about 10 minutes for them to get to is for our order and then 15 minutes after we ate for our check.   For a party of 10, 3 adults and 6 kids $120(kids eat free-not sure what age) it was worth it."
Black bear doesn't disappoint. Great service and really good food in large portions. I really enjoyed my experience.
5 stars.  The food is fantastic.  And you'll get plenty.
"Good food, big portions, clean restaurant and very kind staff. Vanessa advised us not to leave baggages in our car, thank you."
"Food was excellent, long wait heads up."
"The place is bad, the food is terrible, and the service is slow and bad. And even the natural water tasted ugly. Everything tasted ugly."
Great menu to satisfy your hunger with enough portion size on the plate to take home. The parking is good and service can differ depending on the amount of flow for dinner rush or the lunch rush other than that take your lady on a good date or family on a nice meal
Good diner
I have been here multiple times and I haven‚Äôt had any issues with my order the food is good and the multiple waiters that have took my order on different occasions were very friendly
Sunrise mimosa is delicious!
Took too long to get my order. Grits were a bit more soupy than what I am used to. I will go again at a different time.
Great food. Had french toast
"Black Bear Diner is a go-to local diner. Relaxed and friendly atmosphere, the food is good value for the cost, and the staff are all hardworking too. I always enjoy visiting with my mom when I'm in town."
Always a great choice any time of day!
Quality Diner Grub. We got take out and the servings were MASSIVE.  The Chicken Fried Steak will put you in a lovely coma.
Fresh fruit dissatisfaction
"Great Cod, Shrimp, Salmon, and sides.
Excellent service on a Saturday night."
Good attention and the. Very delicious food and large portions. Try the meat
Original Scrambowl was delicious
"Food was really good,  but the wait staff were never around and some were rude."
My client  likes to go and eat there.  Sometimes the food is good and other times not so good.

Food and portions were great
It has a country diner feel to it it's very clean the staff is very attentive the food is absolutely delicious
"Great food, lots of food and great service.  What more can someone ask for?"
My favorite place for a good breakfast
Super angry I always enjoy black bear on oakland but I was running some errands at Hayward and today at 9:30 am we went for breakfast and ask for a special of steak and eggs and they refused to gave it to us we ask to speak to the manager ‚Ä¶
Terrible all around. Waitress didn't care. Never even asked how we wanted our burger. (We like med/rare) It was way over done. The chili on top was ice cold from the fridge (what spoonful there was) which made the burger cold. The fries ‚Ä¶
"I really like their food, very tasty.  Also, I love their cornbread. Service has been pretty good too."
"Steak a little overcooked, hash browns burned edges, eggs and toast good."
"Wow, this one is off the Hayward radar.  Pretty quality place."
Great food and very friendly staff. There aren‚Äôt many restaurants that aren‚Äôt corporate in this area so we weren‚Äôt sure what to expect but this place is definitely worth going to.
"I have only been here for breakfast and was pleasantly surprised. Food was plenty, hot and tasty."
"I liked good food, good portion"
"Great experience ask for Esteban
very good at his job. Esteban is personable, accurate with his orders, knows all the options in the menu. They need to give this guy a raise he is a rockstar and a great representation of a professional. Will b back !!"
I've been here 5 times and each time something goes wrong between the order and the kitchen either missing items or overcooking food that can not eat.   The waitresses are short-handed since the pandemic. The ones that are there are doing their very best but I don't see that in the kitchen.
The Denver omelet was delicious service was great price reasonable what more could you ask for?!
"I just don‚Äôt know what is worst, food or customer service. I‚Äôve been to too many breakfast places but Black Bear Diner is definitely the top least on my  bucket list. ‚Ä¶"

The best salads over all the restaurants in the area! Excellent attention.
Denny's with better atmosphere.
Very good service
So good
"We were here day after Christmas with friends. Foods were great as usual, but slow in coming out kitchen. Service was kind of slow for some reason. Out of all Black Bear, we love going here due to their good service. Maybe it's just that day I hope"
"A decade or two ago, this place was a destination.
Now it's a disappointment."
Fun diner
Great breakfast restaurant
Classic diner.
A good place for a late night meal.
Ordered the tender and rib dinner. The renders were good but the ribs were overcooked. They were so tough that it was a struggle to cut with a steak knife. Will not order ribs if I come back.
Chilly was served cold And is ewwww .. pink beAns ..service is not welcoming
I greatly appreciate the attentive waiters & waitresses that they have for their customers. I am looking forward in visiting with them in the nearer future.
"Used to like Black Bear, but over the last month they consistently cancel delivery orders, both on Grubhub and Uber Eat. If you don't want to have to fill delivery orders that is fine, just take your self off the delivery services."
A good dining experience you can enjoy
Customer service not up to par. Very weak.I call for 20min and nobody answered the phone.  The food is ok.

I forgot how good this place is. The biscuits and gravy is so good. My partner loved his country fried steak and he said he liked the mouth spice the mama bear hot sauce had.
Our server was amazing.  He was so brave to take 21 people with separate checks. Pedro Gonzalez is a Christmas angel.  Rueben sandwich and salad were excellent.  Thanks!
Very busy Sunday morning visit. Wait to be seated was 20 minutes but wait for food was a bit long.  Staff was very nice. They even moved us to a larger table.

Great service.  Super nice staff.

"Went there twice and loved it every time. Staff is very friendly and does a great job, food is seriously delicious. I recommend!"
"It seems like there was only one waitress on our side.  She was doing the best she could, but my food was cold.  The butter could not even melt on my cold French toast.  The coffee was pretty nasty too."
Good overall and I like the cheese burgers there.
Togo ordered late at night good food great portions great service.
Food was good waitress took a long time to get some of our items

"Great hearty meals at a reasonable price. We even did a Black Bear Thanksgiving last year, though they were skimpy on the turkey the rest made up for it. Good flow of folks you can expecte, and the wait isn't that bad. For a hearty meal and good service you should try Black Bear."
It was fast and the staff were patient with my requests. Good experience!
Busy. At least 20 waiting to be seated. No Matter! 15 minutes and that's all it took. Isabel was nice enough to find me a table near an outlet (needed it for my laptop). Vatsana! was my waitress. Enjoyed having her. Wonderful girl with a ‚Ä¶
"I used to like this place, but service has been terrible lately. You sit for 20-30 minutes and nobody bothers to even take drink orders. The place is much bigger than the number of employees working in it."

Excellent  service good food .
I have never been disappointed by a Black Bear dinner
Food was delicious and hot enjoyed.

Amazing portions
There was one waitress for the entire outdoor seating area during the busiest time of their day. We had a party of 10 for my father's birthday. I ordered their signature chicken fried steak and it was literally cold when it was put in front ‚Ä¶

He was friendly, courteous and on top of his game. I would give Enrique 5 stars. ‚Ä¶"
Felt sick after. Steak was too salty and dry.

"Their Hot Turkey Sandwich comes & goes which is very disappointing. I love the sandwich, don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not always on the menu. Unhappy customer."
"Wow, the days of being able to find a restaurant open at 2am are long gone. However lucky for us we found this Black Bear open. The server was attentive and welcoming. The cook did a great job, even though the breakfast dishes we ordered were simple ingredients, they were executed very well."
Great place
"If I could give a negative review for service I would... After reading the paper on the menu of their motto, I thought it was going to be an Excellent Experience. However, it was far from it! ‚Ä¶"
They was alittle bit slow.   I can't believe that they ran out of French fries.   But i got onions rings instead.   And my toast was burnt.    I like the place but i guess this day they was having problems.

"My first time dinning in the Black Bear Restaurant. It was ok. The environment was good, kinda unique theme for a restaurant. Parking maybe a bit issue when busy. Still it is in the bay area, DO NOT leave anything in your car anytime. ‚Ä¶"
Gotta have their chicken fried steak it's my favorite
"Food was good, nice workers"
A great place to eat specially if you have a huge appetite! I've been going to this place since it opened years ago and my review is a long time coming. A highly recommended restaurant.
"Great, but could do without the masks. I'm hearing impaired and had to kept looking at my brother for what the waitress/waiter said. My Hobo Omelette was proper. Kinda wish there was a beer menu vs bottomless mimosas."
Great food and good service
Had the worst  Ruben sandwich ever !!!
Slow food service....took forever to get our food but friendly and food was great!
Dr Prager Veggie Burger Was Pretty Good
Fantastic
"This place was great! We didn't have to wait that long for seating, as there was some available when we walked in. We ordered some breakfast food, but the potatoes tasted a little off to me. Otherwise, this was a great place to eat at!"

"Well, Black Bear used to be good. The service was over an hour. Even though the place was almost empty, repeated requests were ignored. Menu has changed and the food was okay at best. Maybe it's just this location?"
Great place to eat I would recommend it anytime
Simply the best pies
Nice food nice server.
Good food and good portions. Every meal could probably be two meals. Highly recommend the chocolate cream pie.
Delicious waffles and pancakes! And the service was great too!
"Huge portion compared to food in Singapore. Good place, enjoyed it."
"Enjoyed everything, great meal,service was fabulous, very pleased and will be going back !!"
A fun place to eat.
"Everything is in the traditions of American cuisine. Large portions, very good service."
Solid breakfast
Great food as always but the service could have used a little work though the service girls were busy gossiping to each other rather then attending quickly to a rather empty restaurant on a tuesday afternoon around 3 .. But hey I was hangry with my mama and she gave black bear another chance so 5 stars to the food coming in for the win.
Decent place to have a fulfilling meal. Had a real good burger and the desert will top you off.
The burgers üçî are awesome ‚Ä¶

"My friend ordered dinner, so I asked for potpie....
EPIC FAIL. The top of the shell is soggy and green... When I moved the top to look under it to try to eat around that shish, inside looked WORSE!!! Very watery ‚Ä¶"
Orderd food for 6 ppl they got every single order wrong or missing add ons
Great food and service went there for breakfast and got the Bear's choice. This is a very good for customization and picking out what you like and a good pricing. Friendly staffing and a great place to take your family for breakfast just ‚Ä¶
We had the worst experience ever at this location.  We were sat in a corner our server was very inattentive to us but she paid attention to every table around us. ‚Ä¶

Good food and friendly people.
"Food was good, getting robbed in the parking lot and the management shrugging it off like it's just another normal day was unacceptable.  If you're from out of state, don't go here.  The cop told me this place's parking lot has a car broken ‚Ä¶"

"Excellent meal for breakfast with huge plates, pretty much always get full from one plate here. Pretty good, friendly helpful service today"
Me and my friend ended up walking out because of poor service or the lack of service after being seated. I'm not sure why in a half empty restaurant we watched others being served as we were skipped over.
"Not dog friendly, at least today.not doing outdoor seating per staff"

"So very disappointed.  We have frequented BBD in La Habra, Ca. Often. WE have enjoyed every meal we have had there. Excellent food and service. We as a family travelled to Hayward to help our son move there.  Being unfamiliar with the area, ‚Ä¶"
"Large plates plenty to bring home. Good clean food & flavors. It was enjoyable a bit pricey for breakfast. But when you ate the remainder for dinner , it worked itself out. ‚Ä¶"
"I ordered a taco salad. Looks really good, but I ate some of the ground beef. & All I tasted was fat & grease in the meat. Plus the meat was ice cold, no flavor, whatsoever & very mushy. I had my family there too, they even asked how they ‚Ä¶"
We waited 45 minutes for a table once we were sited this white family came in and just went and grab a table without waiting and no body says anything to them I guess is just white  Privilege
This place use  to be good . The last time I was there I had a problem  and the manager didn't  even care and just walked away
The food at black bear diner was good but the service sucked. It took forever for our food to come and then when I asked for a container the server forgot about it until she saw me sitting there staring at her. I do not recommend this place
"Everything was great
Enjoy the food and the company

"Friendly staff, great food and clean"

The food is great and no long wait

Love Chicken Fried Steak
Our favorite neighborhood restaurant.
"Had a nicer server, I asked her for advice on food to eat. Great choice was given.
BTW,  I accidentally fed the bears on the way out.. My bad !!!"
"We enjoyed the breakfast. The staff was nice. Tho they were short staffed in the kitchen. It was a little slow to get our meal. It was worth it. So be patient, remember we are still in a pandemic."
Our food was delicious! We have one near our home in SoCal and we've never gone to it. Now we have a new breakfast spot that we love!
"It took several minutes after entering to be noticed. I wasn't sure they were open!
Slow to take our order, then a very long wait to receive barely luke warm food. ‚Ä¶"

"The servers were beautiful,  friendly and so professional."
"Poor preparation and presentation. Even after voicing a complaint to the manager I was offered any compensation, except an apology. I guess I should be content with at least an apology.  Will not go back or recommend to my organization."
Service is good and the is  Delicious
Breakfast was terrific!!

Quick and attentive staff. Received food within 15 minutes after placing the order.
"Everything was very good, thank you, I loved the drink (mimosa), they give you extra wine and juice so you can have about two, and the food is very good as in all Black Bears."
"The last two times I went there and ordered a new york steak and eggs, I ordered my steak medium rare and....the steak was way too overcooked and dry....."

Good burger
"Service was shotty, as if they were trying to be nice, but they were annoyed it was our first time there. The server's questions while taking our order were unclear, then he seemed bothered that we asked him to clarify. The food was plenty ‚Ä¶"
Rude tables are dirrty the waiters had an attitude there's 3 people in the restaurant and 2 of us neither one away dollars rasqas if there's anything else that we need I highly highly do not recommend this restaurant
"Lousy attitude from the start, from 1st cup of coffee and it went downhill from there. My NY steak way overdone, wanted medium, my over easy eggs way overdone, my shredded hash browns, just thrown on the plate, wasn‚Äôt turned over when ‚Ä¶"

Love the outdoor seating
If you are seated outside to get very little service. Also the outside seating breakfast gets cold way too fast.
Great food and huge portions!
Best one in the east bay. Stay away from the one in oakland and Emeryville

One of my favorite restaurants. Staff is nice. Good music. Chill vibes. Really good food. Not skimpy with the portions. Worth the money.
Excellent.... Food and Service was Wonderful....CHEERS guys ......!!!!!

Best diner food in this side of Hayward
Nice place. Service is efficient and food is served in a necessary time frame. Better than the black bear in Colma! üòé ‚Ä¶
This place is disgusting and the food taste and smells like it's coming from the same sink they wash there mop bucket.. The host had an attitude and rolled her eyes like she been having a bad day. The waitress didn't even ask how I wanted my steak cooked and it came out disgusting and no taste. Felt like I was eating cardboard
"Excelente service,  good food"

If you truly love comfort food large portions reasonable price homey atmosphere nice Food Service this is the place to go especially in the winter time if you do not feel like cooking I recommend the pot roast or the chicken fried steak with gravy and mashed potatoes it is a win-win-win anytime
"Garbage cans in the parking lot blocking passage and parking spots, silverware filthy, empty sugar packets in between jelly and salt... MANAGEMENT FAILING!  Employees don't care and have no pride in a job well done.  Sure glad the chef has pride and cooks eggs perfectly."
Very disappointed in this visit.  I was looking forward to having dinner here for a little while now.  How complicated is it to make a salad? I asked them to hold one ingredient and they couldn‚Äôt even do that. The waitress asked me what ‚Ä¶
Took long with our orders and when I got my food it had a long hair.
